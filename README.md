PROJECT EXPERIENCE

Project Name: IoT Enabled LoRa based Power Theft Detection System
Duration: August 2021 - March 2022

Project Overview: 
This project addressed the critical issue of power theft, which has been causing substantial losses for electric utilities, particularly in countries like India. The system was designed to detect unauthorized power usage on distribution lines, potentially saving significant amounts of energy. The solution could be implemented using the distributed networks of the power supply system, providing real-time data and pinpointing the specific locations of power theft. 

The project also highlighted the need for a secure and reliable electricity grid today, underscoring the inadequacies of traditional energy infrastructure. It pointed towards the global trend of transitioning to smart grids, which offer two-way transmission, high reliability, and real-time monitoring, thanks to advancements in data systems and communication technologies. The smart grid components include smart meters, electrical components, sensors, and software components for power statistics observation and control. This project developed an IoT-enabled LoRa-based system to detect unauthorized power usage on distribution lines. Leveraging LoRa's long-range communication and distributed network capabilities, the system accurately identifies tapped lines in real-time.
